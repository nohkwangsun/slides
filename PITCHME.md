## "Apache Spark™ is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing."
- Ease of Use
  - Write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL.
    ```scala
    df = spark.read.json("logs.json")
    df.where("age > 21")
      .select("name.first").show()

     * Spark's Python DataFrame API
     * Read JSON files with automatic schema inference
     *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***/
    ```
    
- Generality
  - Combine SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.
  
  ![Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming. You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.](https://spark.apache.org/images/spark-stack.png)
